# python-challenge
The python script for this PyBank and PyPoll programs are based on the codes provided by the in-class assignments from the U of T Data Analysis bootcamp. ChaGPT was also used in the assistance of debugging and refactoring the script.

The purpose of the PyBank script is to look through the financial records of a bank through the dataset "budget_data.csv".  This will bring out the values such as the total number of months in the dataset, the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.

The purpose of the PyPoll script is to look through the poll data "election_data.csv".  The script will give out the values such as the total number of votes cast, a complete list of candidates who recieved votes, the percentage of votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election based on popular vote.
